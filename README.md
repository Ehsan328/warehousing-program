#warehousing program created by python and designed with qt designer and save information with docx 

# first of all move the files in a file (its name must be Ehsan) in drive C
# then run the warehouseui.py file

# install these with pip: pyQt5, docx and you need to have python in your pc too

# there's an exe file of this project but i can't put it in github.

# in this project i use docx library to save and read information, i could use "pickle" to do these but with docx user can read and print information from a word file in program folder (inventory, history)
